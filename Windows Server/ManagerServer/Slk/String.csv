Although we do not know when you will be back, we will keep them for you. Come back to see us when you are free, let's play together. And do not forget, we are always waiting for you."
3322,"Buddy, do you still remember the excitement of when you first log in to BOI; the first time you collected a set of Soul Gear; the first time you fought with your dear friends in the game; the first time you set up a Guild? After you left, more new things came to BOI, there's more fun to be had, and your buddies are still waiting for you! Your friends still need you! Come back!"
3323,"Where have you been buddy? Without you, life in BOI is boring. Do you remember how happy we were every day we undertook trials, like the Hexagram Event, the Dark Deity Dragon and the days we activated the Combat Aid in Rocky? Now BOI has updated to a new version, and many changes have come to the game. It's especially more convenient in Atlantis. Come back buddy, we all miss you. No buddies, no BOI."
3324,"Busy life puts people under a lot of pressure, causing them to feel tired and empty-headed. Buddy, are you one of those people? Free yourself, there's always work to be done! Relax and play BOI, there are beautiful girls in the game and other fun stuff. Don't hesitate, let's go!"

Although it is dim and dull, if only you hold it in your hands, it will glitter again! Come back! Warrior! Reunite with your old partners in BOI, let the glory reign again! Let the dream continue to fly! Let your name echo through Atlantis again! Release your passion again to write a new chapter in the legend!"

The spring in Atlantis witnessed our love, and the event Dream Lover validated our fate. But now you've already gone, and left me alone. But I believe you just temporarily left, and one day you will come back. Please don't forget, I am still in BOI waiting for you."
3328,"Dear, do you still remember the first time we met in the game at Freya? We were in the one team to answer the questions and we got a 99 match score. That's my first time taking the Love Match event. Later we challenged instances together, did quests together, and I was so happy with you. I miss you so much, I miss those good old days so much. Please come back, my dear, I really miss you."
3329,"That was a sunny day, I was just entered BOI and soon I was lost in a brand new world. I asked help from the passing crowd, only you stopped for me. Thanks for taking care of me. I was really happy in those days. Although your leave really made me sad, but I believe, departure is for the next encounter."
3330,"I never stopped missing you from the day you left BOI. My feelings for you are so strong that they make me choke. For you to be by my side again, I wrote down your name in the pyramids, but it was taken away by Set; I wrote down your name in Poseidon's Temple, but it was taken away by Poseidon; so I wrote down your name on every corner in Atlantis, and I, was taken away by the guarding troops..."
